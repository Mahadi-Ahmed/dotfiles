### stow commands

##### stow --dotfiles [folder i want to link]

##### stow -n (n stand for no) it is used to preview what it would do without actually doing it.

##### stow -v (v stands for verbose)

##### stow -S (S stands for stow)

##### stow -D for unstow for unlinking

##### stow t (t stands for target directory)
t ~ (means target directory) it's not usually taught since it's the default, but it's better to specify.

##### stow -nvSt ~ * (* stands for everything)
Use this when you want to restore a file from the repo when setting up a new env, remove the **-n** after you've tried it once 

##### stow -vDt ~ (insert directory) this would unlink the desired dot file,s yet it won't delete them.
